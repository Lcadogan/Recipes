# Recipes
Program for storing recipes in one place.
Created a multi-user web service using SpringBoot that allows you to store, retrieve, update and delete recipes.
When creating it, I used JSON, REST API, Spring Boot, Spring Security, H2 or PostgreSQL database, LocalDateTime, Project Lombok and other concepts useful for the back end.
